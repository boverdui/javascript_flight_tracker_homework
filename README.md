# API Weekend Homework

Fetch information from an API. Display the information in the browser using DOM manipulation / Maps / Canvas etc.

## Learning Objectives

- Manipulating the DOM - selecting/creating/appending elements
- Using event listeners to make our apps interactive
- Making an HTTP request to retrieve some data and then using it
- Practice using webpack to allow us to structure our front-end code more nicely

## APIs

GitHub user toddmotto maintains [a HUGE list of links to open APIs](https://github.com/toddmotto/public-apis) on many subjects. We _**strongly**_ recommend that you avoid APIs which require OAuth authentication. APIs which are listed as requiring an API key require a _little_ bit of extra work, but this should be documented on the API's website. How to attach the API key along with your requests may differ between APIs, but should also be documented on their site.

In particular we recommend:

- No API key required
  + REST countries: https://restcountries.eu/
  + Harry Potter: http://hp-api.herokuapp.com/
  + PokeAPI - Pokemon Data: https://pokeapi.co/
- API key required but still recommended if you want to use them
  + Football Data: http://api.football-data.org/index - Make sure you sign up for a Free API key to use in your requests otherwise you may get CORS errors in Chrome.
  + News API: https://newsapi.org/ - News stories from several different sources
  + Giphy API: https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI - fun gifs! Free key provided.
  + Open Weather Map: http://openweathermap.org/api - Free API key on sign up.
  + MusixMatch: https://developer.musixmatch.com/ - get info on music charts, artists and their music, lyrics. Free API key when you sign up.
  + OMDB - Film info: http://www.omdbapi.com/ - no key needed.
